## About Me

I design and build automation systems that turn messy workflows into reliable, scalable platforms.

With over 8 years of experience in backend and full-stack development, I specialize in:

- Automation systems for business operations
- API integrations and workflow orchestration
- Data normalization and processing pipelines
- Backend architectures with long-term reliability

I combine tools like **n8n, Make.com, and APIs** with custom backend logic and databases when no-code solutions are not enough.

## Core Focus

- Business process automation
- Marketplace & order processing systems
- Dashboard-driven operational visibility
